        <value>
			<description>A chemical addiction to battle elixir. Long-term presence of the substance has caused neurological adaptations at the cellular level, so the brain can no longer function properly without the drug.
	\nWithout regular doses of battle elixir, withdrawal symptoms will begin. However, extended abstinence will force the brain to adapt back to its normal state, resolving the addiction.</description>
