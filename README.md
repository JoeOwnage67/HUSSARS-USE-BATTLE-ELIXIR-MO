**Medieval Overhaul: Battle Elixir for Hussars**

**Description**

This patch should replace Hussar xenotype's genetic dependence on Go Juice with Medieval Overhaul's Battle Elixir.  
  
Support is built-in for Uhlan xenotype from VRE: Hussar, changing their addiction immunity to Battle Elixir and renaming references to "Luciferium" to "devil's blood potion" if BotchJob's Medieval Fantasy Themed Quest Rewards is loaded.  
  
This will do nothing if Biotech is not loaded.
