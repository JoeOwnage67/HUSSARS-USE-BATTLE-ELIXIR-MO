			                <description>Hussars are trained as soldiers from birth. They fight aggressively and with precision, heal fast, thrive in extreme temperatures, and freely ingest battle elixir. They have a genetic dependence on the drug, which also makes them less likely to rebel against their commanders.\n\nWhile hussars' emotions make them dangerous in combat, they can't relate to baseliner humans. They are famous for their blood-red eyes and "hussar stare", a dead expression that unsettles many people. Their lack of expression and burning aggressive nature has led to many violent misunderstandings.\n\nIn most societies where they live, hussars are kept separated from the rest of the population. Hussars are single-purpose tools - and they generally aren't bothered by the fact.</description>
